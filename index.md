### ClockApp

Our first app, ClockApp is our first iOS application which has been a learning curve for us to say the least.

ClockApp was born from our frustration at how the iOS clock alarm feature made it difficult to set daily alarms
and see all of your alarms at a glance. 

[ClockApp is Available on Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clockapp/id1665577014)
